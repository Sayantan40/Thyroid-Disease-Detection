# Thyroid-Disease-Detection

# Description: 
At least a person out of ten is suffered from thyroid disease in India. The
disorder of thyroid disease primarily happens in the women having the age 
of 17–54. The extreme stage of thyroid results in cardiovascular 
complications, increase in blood pressure, maximizesthe cholesterol level,
depression and decreased fertility. The hormones, total serum thyroxin 
(T4) and total serum triiodothyronine (T3) are the two active thyroid 
hormones produced by the thyroid gland to control the metabolism of 
body. For the functioning of each cell and each tissue and organ in a right
way, in overall energy yield and regulation and to generate proteins in the 
ordnance of body temperature, these hormones are necessary.
The basis of classification of thyroid disease is euthyroidism, hyperthyroidism 
and hypothyroidism which are denoting normal, excessive or defective levels
of thyroid hormones. The state euthyroidism depictsthe normal production of 
thyroid hormones and normal levels at the cellular level by the thyroid gland. 
The state hyperthyroidism is clinical symptom due to excessive circulation and 
intracellularthyroid hormones. The state hypothyroidism is most of due to the 
lack of thyroid hormone generation and poor alternate therapy.
Cure of disease is a regular concern for the health care practitioners, and the 
errorless diagnostic at the right time for a patient is very important. Recently, 
by some advanced diagnosis methods, the common medical report can be 
generated with an additional report based on symptoms. The different
questions like ‘‘what are the causes for affecting the thyroid?’’, ‘‘Which age 
group of people are affected due to thyroid?’’, ‘‘what is the relevanttreatment
for a disease?’’. All these answers we can find on implementing machine 
learning methods on Health care data. Health care data can be processed and 
after implementing with certain methodologies; it can provide information
that can be used in diagnosis and treatment of diseases more efficiently and
accurately with better decision making and minimizing the death risk

The solution proposed here is a data science model based on machine learning can be 
implemented to perform above mention use cases. In first use case, we will take input from 
a healthy person who is not suffering from thyroid disease and see whether proposed
solution is going to detect it or not. And in second use case, we will take input from an
unhealthy person, already suffering from thyroid disease and check oursolution whether it 
is performing or not in right way
